App Brainstorming

-Instagram:
  * I like the reaction to any story feauture.
  * The new way to write notes or even post a song.
  * The reals section.

- Twitch
  * Recommend live streamings by categories (games, just chatting, Sports).
  * Channels recommendations for you based on streamers that you usually consume.
  * verify email and account, so there is a control over fake accounts and boots.

- Wallet App
  * Keep tickets or passes for any event for simple check-in.
  * add credit or debit card for making purchases with phone instead than using the physical card.
 
App idea:
  I would like to create an app about Technology news. The user will have access to the later news, blogs, articles about what is happening in the technology world. Computer's news, blogs about machine learning or even a section for the game development sector. A simple app just to scroll and try to find the perfect and more interesting article for you to read.
